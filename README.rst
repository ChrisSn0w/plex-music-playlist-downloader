**Plex Music Playlist Downloader**

A Python script to download music files from Plex playlists to a local drive or USB thumb drive.

THe audio system in my car plays mp3 and other audio files from a USB thumb drive. This simple script utilizes the python api wrapper written by pkkid  https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi to download mp3/audio files from all audio playlists in Plex. Folders with the name of each playlist are created in the current directory and the audio filed are stored in those folders.

*Note:* This is a python 3 script. 

Run it in the directory where the scriot is stored (and where you want the music to be downloaded) with the following command: python3 dl_plex_playlist.py

*Enjoy,*
